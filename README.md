# Data Structures Projects

## Overview

This repository contains multiple projects that I worked on during the summer of 2023 to explore data structures and learn about object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The projects implemented key data structures such as the array-based stack, linked list-based queue, and more. Through these projects, I gained valuable insights into managing data efficiently and effectively.

## Project Details

### Array-Based Stack

The **Array-Based Stack** project involved the implementation of a stack data structure using arrays in C++. The stack adheres to the last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle and is capable of managing a collection of elements. The project aimed to strengthen my understanding of arrays and their application in data structures.

### Linked List-Based Queue

The **Linked List-Based Queue** project focused on creating a queue data structure using linked lists in C++. The queue operates on the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle and allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements. Implementing this project provided valuable experience in working with linked lists and their applications.

### Object-Oriented Programming

In addition to the specific data structure projects, I also dedicated time to exploring **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in C++. I learned about classes, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. These OOP principles are fundamental to building modular and maintainable software solutions.

## File Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `array_based_stack.h`: Contains the necessary function signatures for the array-based stack.

- `array_based_stack.cpp`: Implementation of the array-based stack.

- `linked_list_based_queue.h`: Function signatures for the linked list-based queue.

- `linked_list_based_queue.cpp`: Implementation of the linked list-based queue.

- `main.cpp`: A testing file containing comprehensive tests for all implemented data structures.

## How to Use

To explore the projects and understand the implementation of data structures:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/chittaphrrr/csci152_-sabyrova-.git
   ```

2. Open the project directory and review the implementation files (`array_based_stack.cpp` and `linked_list_based_queue.cpp`) to see how each data structure is constructed.

3. You can run the `main.cpp` file to test the data structures and validate their correctness:

   ```
   g++ -o main main.cpp array_based_stack.cpp linked_list_based_queue.cpp
   ./main
   ```
